# ML-Algorithms

I have listed the basic Supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, and their implementation from very basic.

Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs, whereas Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm used to draw inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labeled responses.

The Project includes various Regression and Classification Algorithms as well, for example: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SVM Classification,K-Means Clustering and etc.
